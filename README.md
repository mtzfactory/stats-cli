# STATS CLI

Small dashboard to show the different network cell Kpi stored in a database.

_This was my first web app and it was early __2016__,_ so, __Angular__ seemed a good option to start with.

The backend was done in raw __Php__ and __MySql__ as the database, nothing shinny there, just the functions to filter the table...

## Development server

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.15.

Clone the repo and do:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mtzfactory/stats_cli.git
$ cd stats_cli
$ npm install
```

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Remember that you need your own MySql server and you have to edit the configuration settings in `connect2.php`.

## Screens

Â· There's only one page, showing all the related KPI of the filtered cell.
